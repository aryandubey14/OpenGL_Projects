# 2D Transformations

2D transformations are mathematical operations applied to objects in a two-dimensional plane to manipulate their position, size, and orientation.
These transformations are fundamental in computer graphics for rendering scenes, animations, and simulations.

## Types of 2D Transformations

- ### Translation
- ### Scaling
- ### Rotation
- ### Reflection
- ### Shearing


## Applications

- Computer Graphics & Animation (Game development, UI animations)
- Image Processing (Scaling, rotating images)
- Robotics & Simulation (Object positioning and movement)
