# OpenGL Projects

## Overview

This repository showcases a collection of computer graphics projects implemented using OpenGL. Each project demonstrates fundamental concepts and algorithms in computer graphics.

## Project List

1. **2D Transformations**
   - Demonstrates basic 2D transformations such as translation, scaling, rotation, and shearing.

2. **3D Transformations**
   - Illustrates 3D transformations including translation, scaling, rotation, and perspective projections.

3. **Animation**
   - Features simple animations to demonstrate motion and timing in graphics.

4. **Bézier Curve**
   - Implements Bézier curves to illustrate curve generation and manipulation.

5. **Bresenham's Algorithm**
   - Demonstrates the Bresenham's line drawing algorithm for efficient rasterization of lines.

6. **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)**
   - Implements the DDA algorithm for line generation.

7. **Line Clipping**
   - Showcases line clipping algorithms like Cohen-Sutherland for rendering only visible portions of lines.

## Getting Started

To run these projects on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
