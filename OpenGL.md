# OpenGL Projects

## Overview

This repository showcases a collection of computer graphics projects implemented using OpenGL. Each project demonstrates fundamental concepts and algorithms in computer graphics.

## Project List

1. **2D Transformations**
   - Demonstrates basic 2D transformations such as translation, scaling, rotation, and shearing.

2. **3D Transformations**
   - Illustrates 3D transformations including translation, scaling, rotation, and perspective projections.

3. **Animation**
   - Features simple animations to demonstrate motion and timing in graphics.

4. **Bézier Curve**
   - Implements Bézier curves to illustrate curve generation and manipulation.

5. **Bresenham's Algorithm**
   - Demonstrates the Bresenham's line drawing algorithm for efficient rasterization of lines.

6. **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)**
   - Implements the DDA algorithm for line generation.

7. **Line Clipping**
   - Showcases line clipping algorithms like Cohen-Sutherland for rendering only visible portions of lines.

## Getting Started

To run these projects on your local machine:

1. **Prerequisites**
   Ensure you have the following installed:
   - A C++ compiler (GCC, MSVC, or Clang)
   - OpenGL libraries
   - GLUT (or FreeGLUT) for handling windowing and input

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryandubey14/OpenGL_Projects.git
   cd OpenGL_Projects
   
3. **Compiling and Running a Project**
   Navigate to the desired project directory and compile it using g++:
   g++ main.cpp -o project -lGL -lGLU -lglut./project
