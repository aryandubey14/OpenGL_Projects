# 3D Transformations

3D transformations are mathematical operations applied to objects in a three-dimensional space to manipulate their position, size, orientation, and perspective.
These transformations are crucial in computer graphics for modeling, rendering, and animation.

## Types of 3D Transformations

- ### Translation
- ### Scaling
- ### Rotation
  - Around X Axis
  - Around Y Axis
  - Around Z Axis
- ### Reflection
  - Along XY Plane
  - Along YZ Plane
  - Along XZ Plane
- ### Shearing


## Applications

- 3D Game Development & Animation
- Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
- Virtual & Augmented Reality
- Medical Imaging & Simulations
