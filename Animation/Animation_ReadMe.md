# Animation in OpenGL

Animation in OpenGL involves updating the properties of objects over time and redrawing the scene at regular intervals to create the appearance of motion.

## Key Concepts in the Code

1) glutTimerFunc: Used to schedule periodic updates for the animation.
2) State Updates: The angle variable is updated to create a rotation effect.
3) Double Buffering: GLUT_DOUBLE ensures smooth rendering by drawing on a back buffer and swapping it with the front.
